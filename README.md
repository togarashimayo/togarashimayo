Welcome to my GitHub! 

I'm a 20-something junior software dev, anime convention fan presenter, and aspiring cosplayer.

While I get my actual website set up (in which I will create a separate repo for its code), this README will act as a temporary "site" for now.

## Interests

:keyboard: Tech - I am curious about:
* UI/UX
* How data is collected and manipulated
* Writing clear and concise documentation
* How my lifestyle interests integrate into technology

:bar_chart: Panels -  My panel-running interests include:
* Asian comics and animation produced outside of Japan (such as manhua and donghua) 
* The (anime) link between Japan and non-Japanese countries speaking my target languages
* The history of anime
* Personal finance in context of fan conventions

:gem: Other - Outside of work, tech, and fandom work, I'm seen:
* Checking out a new local restaurant
* Making some sort of ice cream
* Throwing money into stocks and ETFs
* On my journey to reach a B2 profiency in German (A2.1),  French (A1), Japanese (A1.1) and Mandarin (A0)
